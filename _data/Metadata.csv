etd001,Typographic Emphasis Of Headings: Methods Of Typographic Emphasis To Assist With Search Of Unfamiliar And Familiar Text,pdf,pdf,,"Timpany, Claire","Typography, Reading Comprehension",,"Readers use headings to understand the structure and content of a text, and to locate information. Readers understand the structure of a text by building an understanding of the structure of the content through developing relationships between the sections of content. Headings assist readers with both their comprehension of text as well as assisting them with recall of the content. Headings provide signals to readers to aid navigation of a document by indicating the structure of topics. This helps readers to locate information both through signalling the content of text that may be unfamiliar or providing markers to assist with the recall of the location of information in a familiar text. The importance of headings is known; however, little research exists to indicate how these important organisational features of text should be presented visually. This research was undertaken to fill this gap in our understanding of how headings can assist readers. Five studies were carried out to investigate which heading emphasis methods are most easily identified within a passage of text and which of these methods best assist readers with searching text. An initial survey of current practice for emphasising headings revealed that there are six main methods for emphasising headings and these are often used in combination with each other to create stronger emphasis. It was also revealed that the presentation of headings in the same publication across print and digital formats is often inconsistent. This survey was used to help inform which heading emphasis methods were used in the paired comparison studies to test for ease of identification. Three paired comparison studies were then undertaken to establish which methods of typographic emphasis are most easily identified within a passage of text. These studies compared seven individual typographic emphasis methods with each other in print and on screen then compared five combinations of typographic emphasis methods in print and on screen. These studies found that emphasis methods with the greatest visual weight were the most easily identified. The most easily identifiable heading emphasis methods were then evaluated in search tasks to evaluate which of the four heading styles provided the most assistance when searching for answers in a screen-based text. This research showed that when headings are emphasised using styles that combine two heading emphasis methods they are easier to distinguish from the body copy surrounding them. These more easily identifiable headings are more useful to readers when they are searching for information in a text, both when the text is unfamiliar and when it is familiar. When bold is combined with either an increase in size or a sans serif typeface to create a heading, readers are able to more quickly and accurately find information within a document, whether that text is unfamiliar or familiar.",,New Zealand,-37.7866707,175.3156909,2018-00-00,https://hdl.handle.net/10289/12091,https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/12091/thesis.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y,eng,"Cunningham, Sally Jo;Hunt, Lyn",,,,All items in Research Commons are provided for private study and research purposes and are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.,The University of Waikato,Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science,Doctoral,Computer Science,"The University of Waikato

For roman type, Humanistic handwriting was moulded into a preﬁxed standardised system already developed for the production of gothic type. This was possible because there is an intrinsic morphological relationship between the structures of the written textura quadrata and the Humanistic minuscule.

Renaissance typographic patterning was in part determined by prerequisites for the production of type. The typographic conventions are not purely the result of optical preferences predating the invention of movable type but are also the result of the standardisation of characters in the Renaissance type production. By mapping the underlying harmonic and rhythmic aspects, we gain more insight into what exactly the creative process in type design comprises, and what its constraints are. Furthermore, it makes the parameterisation of digital type-design processes possible.",,"Netherlands

Acquiring good typographical skills is crucial for designers to effectively convey information and meaning. These skills should be taught in schools by applying a proper typographic foundation and improving skills through experience. Arabic typography has been recently introduced in Visual Communication Design programs in the Middle East and North African region with an emphasis on typeface design. With the growing demand of designers who possess typographic fluency in the market, introducing a foundation course that teaches Arabic typography became necessary. This thesis documents the process of creating an Arabic typography foundation course that can be integrated across all Visual Communication Design curricula in the Arabic speaking countries. The course has been developed through extracting information from primary research methods, and applying mental models to obtain course features. The emphasis on primary research facilitated the creation of a user-centered course. Students can further develop their typographic skills by applying the knowledge and skills gained from the course in an academic setting throughout the curriculum.

Eduardo Kac, Martin Lambie Nairn,
Kyle Cooper",Fluid characterforms; Temporal Typography; Kineticism; Verbal and Pictorial Signs; Gestalt Psychology; Eduardo Kac,"This thesis identifies and characterises a particular kind of temporal typography in which verbal forms exhibit behaviours that have been identified by Eduardo Kac as ‘fluid’ , and fluctuate between the verbal and pictorial or abstract. A typology will be constructed which identifies the various behaviours by which fluidity is exhibited, and provides terminology for their analysis, accompanied by analysis of how these behaviours address the relationship between the commonly distinct paradigms of verbal and pictorial signs. The work identifies the distinction between fluidity and other forms of kineticism, and explores the various behaviours exhibited in fluid artefacts. When addressing local kineticism, gaps in existing research are filled by employing terms and observations from other fields. For example, Kac offers the term ‘fluid’ in description of his holographic poetry, which exhibits behaviours much like those presented in some examples of screenbased temporal typography. This thesis proposes that Kac’s term, ‘fluid’, may be adopted in order to differentiate significant local change in verbal forms from the various other kinds of kineticism observable in temporal typography. Fluid behaviours are identified in examples including Martin Lambie Nairn and MPC’s Channel 4 idents, the credit sequences of Kyle Cooper, and the typographic animations of practitioners including Komnios Zervos and Dan Waber. This thesis demonstrates that the existing discourse surrounding temporal typography has been held back by a failure to make distinguish between global kineticism (effecting layout) and local kineticism (effecting individual characters). The distinction between the global and the local is considered vital in studies of perceptual organisation, particularly Gestalt psychology. By providing a coherent typology, and consistent terminology, this study has the potential to positively influence understanding and analysis of fluid characterforms.","dc.subject	kinetic	en_US

Para resolver el problema planteado se utilizó el enfoque cualitativo y el diseño metodológico de la teoría fundamentada, en razón a que esta permite la exploración del problema en sí mismo y en el proceso se desarrolla la teoría para su comprensión. De las conclusiones se resalta que, si bien es cierto que los sesgos cognitivos históricamente han sido estudiados en otras disciplinas, también lo es, que en el campo del diseño brillan por su ausencia. Por esta razón, este trabajo investigativo centró su estudio en esta área, argumentando que el conocimiento teórico de los sesgos cognitivos ayudará a entender la toma de decisiones en las diversas tareas y procesos a desarrollar en el ejercicio profesional del diseñador. Finalmente, se considera que este estudio contribuye desde el aspecto teórico al entendimiento de procesos mentales que se presentan en la selección de tipografías digitales. ; The Influence of cognitive biases in digital typography The present research investigation came about through arising difficulties related to the process of selecting digital typographies. In order to develop the investigation two main objectives were formed: to understand the influence that 8 different cognitive biases have on the selection of digital typographies in regards to individual visual design in four advertisement agencies in Bogota, and to analyze the presence of cognitive biases during the typography selection process. To resolve the aforementioned difficulties, a research investigation was formed with a qualitative focus in addition to grounded theory. This structure was formed with the intention to explore the problem within itself and in the process, develop a theory for its comprehension. The conclusions show that even though cognitive biases historically have been studied in other disciplines, there is an absence of cognitive bias research in the area of digital design. It is for this reason the present research project centered on this area, postulating that theoretical knowledge of cognitive biases will help to understand how decisions are made in varios digital projects in addition to processes to develop as an exercise for the professional designer. Finally this research contributes to the theoretical knowledge in understanding mental processes present during digital typography selections.","Trabajo de grado - Maestría.

A partir da seleção de uma amostra significativa de exemplares de tipografias arquitetônicas nominativas, foi desenvolvida uma série de análises, através de um embasamento teórico, fornecido por uma ampla revisão bibliográfica. Como resultado, foi possível verificar que o estilo Art Déco, de grande penetração na arquitetura da cidade de São Paulo no período estudado, se valeu da tipografia de uma maneira particular, conseguindo com isso promover em várias ocasiões uma relação integral dela com a arquitetura. Também foram encontrados indícios de que a reprodução de um determinado desenho de letra, presente em várias edificações no centro da cidade, pode ter se originado a partir de sua utilização no edifício do antigo Banco de São Paulo. Outros indícios apontam ainda para o possível surgimento desse desenho de letra, a partir da instrumentalização do alfabeto escrito manualmente, utilizado nas pranchas dos projetos desenvolvidos pelo escritório do arquiteto Álvaro Botelho, autor do Edifício Banco de São Paulo.;The aim of this Master Thesis is to increase the knowledge about the use of typography as an architectural element in the city of São Paulo, specially in Art Déco style buildings, built between 1928 and 1954, demonstrating how architectural typography established a new relation, not only restricted to the building itself, but also with the urban landscape and its inhabitants, keeping up with the developments in commercial trade and in the communications and entertainment industry. A series of analysis was developed, on a significative sample of nominative architectural letterings, through a theoretical basis provided by a comprehensive literature review. As a result, it was possible to ascertain that the Art Déco style, which was higly pervasive in São Paulo city architecture during the time considered, made use of lettering in a very particular way, enabling it, in many occasions, to set an integral relationship with architecture. Also, traces were found indicating that the reproduction of a certain lettering style, present in several buildings in downtown São Paulo, may have been inspired by its use in the Banco de São Paulo building.

A review of the rise of postmodern critique, particularly as expressed through digital technologies, demonstrates how cultural shifts and developing communications technologies work in tandem to influence the emergence of visual systems. By revealing several underlying premises of modernity, it is shown that the linearity of modern design is a biased and limited theory of vision. This argument is reinforced by contrasting the modern conception of direct communication with alternative design practices that encourage readers to play a more active role in the interpretation of a message. However, the thesis ultimately returns to the fundamental principles of modernism to suggest that certain tenets of modernist thought should not be jettisoned so quickly, simply because digitization encourages open-ended viewing experiences.",,Quebec,45.5047847,-73.5771511,1999-08-01,https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x326p,https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k913f.pdf,eng,"Straw, Will",,,mid-century,All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.,McGill University,Master of Arts,Master’s,Department of Art History and Communication Studies,"McGill University

Past research into temporal typography has focused on changing the size, orientation, color, and position of typographic forms while keeping the letterforms themselves intact. This thesis proposes pliant type as an area of study within temporal typography in which letterforms are malleable shapes which can move in expressive ways. This thesis presents a shape representation for type which allows the manipulation of typographic shapes on a basic level. Two shape representations have been imple­mented: outline and skeletal. In pliant type design experiments, letterforms are created using a shape builder. These shapes then are manipulated through interaction with the user and with computational engines. Pliant type suggests new ideas for expressive visual communica­tion. The research contributes to a broader understanding of temporal typographic design.

etd016,Handcraft As A Rhetorical Prop: An Investigation Into What Handcraft Techniques Offer The Discipline Of Graphic Design,pdf,pdf,,"Van Kampen, Saskia","Design, Fine Arts",Materiality; Design; Handcraft; Craft; Art; Typography; Rhetoric; Feminism; Needlework; Sewing; Graphic design,"This thesis paper examines how handcraft (making an item by analog means using specific materials) can be a compelling rhetorical tool for graphic designers to harness. Contrasting handcraft techniques with computer graphics software “unsettles” rote graphic design practices. The meaning that lies in the physical act of making, the materials that are used and the contexts with which particular handcrafts are associated can support, as well as carry, visual rhetoric in design works. An analysis of the unconventional handcraft work produced by Stefan Sagmeister (USA), Mathias Augustyniak and Michaël Amzalag of M/M (Paris) (France), Marian Bantjes (Canada), and by this author (specifically, a design book produced in tandem with this paper) is used to demonstrate how complex meanings contained within handcrafts can be revealed and used in graphic design. The combination of handcraft and digital techniques enables designers to interweave the disparate social, physical and material qualities of the two processes into their work. In this way the work engages in disciplinary and societal discourse.",,,,,2014-04-22,https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/items/a764d167-afbf-4846-9825-d296a776d326,https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/bitstreams/4968ded7-7187-4457-bc65-d7a1ad1f9236/download,eng,"Cabianca, David",,,,"Author owns copyright, except where explicitly noted.

etd017,Building Character Through Type,pdf,pdf,,"Hall, Eli Marco","Type,Typography",,"Typography, the art of designing with type began in the West around 1455 when Johannes Gutenberg perfected the craft of printing from individual pieces of type. Typography is the graphic designer's domain. It is the vehicle that clearly communicates a message. The expectations of designers are increasingly broadened, and as a result less time is given to understanding the craft. In my professional experience typography has broken down into five specific categories: calligraphy, hand lettering, type design, print design and digital design. Calligraphy is the art of writing, while hand lettering is the art of crafting specific characters for a particular goal. Type design is the creation of an alphabet including all of its characters numbers and glyphs. Print design ranges from movable type to any type where the intended output is print, whereas digital design has been created specifically for digital use. Today's designers are exposed to digital type from the beginnings of their educations. The lack of working, creating and experiencing type in the physical realm combined with the access to thousands of poorly designed typefaces has muddied the understanding of type. In this work, my intent is to expand my knowledge of typography through hand lettering combined with site-specific installations. Within the field of graphic design, typography is the most important element and the hardest to master, therefore it is imperative to learn type through a tactile process. The information you receive through a physical relationship is substantially different than the insight you would receive through an abstract experience.",,,,,2011-10-01,https://mountainscholar.org/items/a1d09a12-b2d2-41bc-845f-064ab2d46fad,https://mountainscholar.org/bitstreams/b732e985-79c9-46aa-bd75-9a6796f4d381/download,eng,"Gravdahl, John","Lundberg, Thomas",,,,,,Master’s,Department of Art,"Colorado State University

etd018,Architecture And Typography: The Space Beyond The Text,pdf,pdf,,"Smith, Adam Mackenzie","Architecture, Typography",Architecture; Typography,"This thesis considers the design of a combined industrial printing and publishing house as a semi-public institution. The site is in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The institution includes a bookstore, archive, studio, book conservation facility, and guest rooms, in addition to printing and publishing. Research included relevant literature, an applied course in typography, and a working visit to Gaspereau Press. The way program elements are brought together and overlap relates to the formal strategies of spatial organization in typography. The design as a setting for human activity relates to the relationship between text and content in the activity of reading. The simultaneous presence of the practical and the creative in the practice of architectural design is also explored in relation to typographic practice. The intention is to clarify both the object of design and the practice of design in comparison to both aspects in typography. This then further clarifies the relation of the program to the built work.","Galvin, Terrance ; Parcell, Steve ; McDonald, Rod ; Jannasch, Emanuel	",Nova Scotia,44.6356313,-63.5977486,2011-03-01,http://hdl.handle.net/10222/13369,https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/13369/Smith_Adam_MArch_ARCH_Apr_2011.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y,eng,,,,,"Permission is herewith granted to Dalhousie University to circulate and to have copied for non-commercial purposes, at its discretion, the above title upon the request of individuals or institutions.

This thesis provides a research-based pedagogy for teaching typography to students in a way that accommodates the visual, processing, and auditory differences present in students with dyslexia. Through the analysis of the learning disability itself, existing material for graphic designers with dyslexia, and current accessibility standards for those with dyslexia, this thesis offers a practical solution to provide a more balanced learning experience for all students, especially those with dyslexia. The aim of this study was to examine the current graphic design standards and refocus and modify them for ease of readability for all individuals, especially those with dyslexia.","Sarah Lynn Hoyt, M.F.A ; First Reader; Andrea Leigh Brake, M.A., M.B.A. ; Second Reader; A.

etd020,Developing A Practice-led Framework To Promote The Practise And Understanding Of Typography Across Different Media,pdf,pdf,,"Yee, Joyce","Typography, Media And Communication",,"This study presents a pedagogic framework that offers a new approach, structure and content for the teaching, understanding and application of typography in cross-media communication environments. Current theory and vocabulary used to describe typographic practice and scholarship are based on a historically print-derived framework. As yet, no new paradigm has emerged to address the divergent path that screen-based typography has taken from its traditional print medium. This study argues that the current model of typographic education is unable to provide design students with appropriate models, concepts and grammar to explore the potential of typography in screen-based media. Hence, a re-evaluation of the current framework is proposed in order to develop new approaches that will reduce misappropriation of typographic principles and aesthetic values in screen-based media. This study is composed of three research stages. Stage One (consisting of a literature and design application review) was used to develop an understanding of the current typographic application in screen-based media. Stage Two (consisting of a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews) was used to investigate the relevance of current typographic knowledge in relation to screen- based media. Additionally, this stage helped identify critical issues surrounding current and future typographic practice. Findings from Stages One and Two were used as a basis to develop a new framework. This framework was subsequently tested and refined in Stage Three through action research projects (with Graphic and New Media design students) and peer reviews (with design educators and professional practitioners). The final framework consists of six key attributes: an integrated model of knowledge, cross-media skills, cross-disciplinary influences, it is communication-focused, flexible and adaptable. It reflects a future model of a convergent media, not a continued separation of print and screen. This framework consists of two distinct areas of knowledge: Global Skills (Form, Content, Expression and Context) and Specialist Skills (Hyper-textuality, Interactivity, Temporality and Usability). It is concluded that the approach and knowledge-base used to teach typography must be modified to reflect the challenges posed by media convergence, where transferable global skills are emphasised across a range of media. Typography's knowledge base has to be expanded to include specialist skills derived from technological and social changes in communication technologies. The principal contributions of the study are: the identification of transferable global typographic skills; the introduction of specialist design skills required for effective cross-media type application; presentation of an integrated model of typographic knowledge and practice; a curriculum guide aimed at helping design educators plan and deliver typography in graphic and multimedia programmes; strategies and approaches to help designers remediate their print- derived knowledge and lastly, as a subject reference guide for visual communication design students. The framework is not offered as an absolute representation of western-based typographic knowledge for cross-media application but instead should be considered as a signpost to help understand the current transition of knowledge between print and screen. Additionally, this framework has been developed and tested within a single educational environment. As a result, variations in teaching and learning styles were not taken into account. Audiences are urged to treat the framework as a 'work-in-progress' model that can be refined through additional field- testing in other educational environments. And finally, the application of the framework within a professional practice environment would require a comprehensive review of practice-based concerns and a further simplification of the framework.",,England,54.9764598,-1.6096459,2006-10-01,https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/developing-a-practice-led-framework-to-promote-the-practise-and-u-3,http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/1122/1/yee.joyce_phd.pdf,eng,"Young, Robert A.",,,,"Northumbria University has developed Northumbria Research Link (NRL) to enable users to access the University’s research output.
