## About

This demo collection showcases how CollectionBuilder-CSV can be used to organize and present Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). Although the current materials are sample entries, the platform is designed to support the aggregation of ETDs from multiple institutions, offering a flexible and accessible framework for digital scholarship.
