## About
This thesis explores the evolving role of typography within the field of visual communication. Blending design experimentation with critical reflection examines how typographic form operates beyond function, shaping and reflecting meaning across conceptual, aesthetic, and cultural dimensions. By engaging multiple media and contexts, the work investigates typography as a visual language and a cultural artifact, revealing its capacity to influence perception, narrative, and identity.
